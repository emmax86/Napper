# Napper
General purpose REST client written in Java

HTTP compliance is a goal, but the client is only designed to handle simple requests to a RESTful server, such as sending JSON objects, form data, URL parameters, and plain text.

Support for HTTP authentication may be implemented later down the road (but really, why would you use HTTP Basic Auth?)
